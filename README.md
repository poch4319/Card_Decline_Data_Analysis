# Card Decline Data Analysis

This is an analysis on the dataset `Globepay Acceptance Report - Globepay Acceptance Report.csv`.
The goal is to figure out what were the reasons behind the declined transactions.

In `task.ipynb` you will see my approach of analysis using mostly `pandas` and plotting packages such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

Alternatively you can check the `Card Decline Report.pptx` for my findings with comprehensive graphs and explaination.

I also incorporated machine learning algorithm `decision tree` to try to figure out the variables that can contribute to the card decline.
